# 2 7-Segment Displays

Thinkcad is used to implement the circuit. The goal of this circuit was to make circuit with a potentiometer that controls 2 7-segment displays to display from 0 to 99. This was completed after connecting 2 CD4511 decoders to the 7-segment displays. Then these 2 decoders were connected to Arduino to receive 4 inputs from this microcontroller.
